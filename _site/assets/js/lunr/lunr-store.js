        "title": "CP violation in charmless B meson decays at the LHCb",
        "excerpt":"Following in the footsteps of the LHCb collaboration, I worked on a project to validate the discovered evidence for CP violation in charmless, B meson decays. I developed a data analysis framework using ROOT to analyse the experimental data obtained by the LHCb experiment and wrote a scientific report on my results. Additionally, I learned a lot about the general work-flow in modern particle physics.   Have a look at my report here:                This browser does not support PDF display.

        "excerpt":"In this project I used neural networks to classify EvtGen simulated data into signal, \\(B \\to K^* \\nu \\bar{\\nu} \\),  and background. The goal was to investigate the possibility of bypassing the expensive Geant4 detector simulation and following analysis. This project was done in the realms of the Belle-II experiment, but is applicable to all of experimental particle physics. It was a very new direction in the collaboration, where I helped to develop one of the first convolutional neutral networks for classification. By restructuring the network layers and managing to constructively input additional data (such as the decay string), I managed to improve the accuracy by over 10% and set the groundwork for future contributions. The project is still ongoing and being constantly improved.   During this project I learned about neural networks, some common design practises and options for handling and pre-processing data. I used Keras and other parts of Tensorflow to embed relevant data from the simulation and develop a convolutional neural network for classification of signal and background in particle collisions. Furthermore, I learned about the simulation side of particle physics and some details about general data handling.  ","categories": [],

        "title": "On the backreaction of quantum scalar fields on the de Sitter spacetime",
        "excerpt":"The questions I wanted to address in my master thesis were: What effect do the particles, created during the expansion of our universe, have on the cosmological evolution?   In this work we analyse the behaviour of a quantised scalar field in a de Sitter background (a model of an exponentially expanding spacetime, which is often used as an approximation for the inflationary phase in the early universe) and the backreaction on the geometry. Due to the dynamic nature of the background no unique vacuum, diagonalising the Hamiltonian at all times, exists on the basis of which we can build a global Fock space. Imposing de Sitter invariance of our vacuum we find a two parameter class of vacua known in the literature as Mottola-Allen vacua, which are invariant under the time-preserving part of the de Sitter symmetry group. Furthermore, fixing one of the mentioned parameters results in a one parameter group of vacua, leaving argument-symmetric Green functions invariant under the full de Sitter group. Lastly, matching our result to the flat Minkowski solutions on very small scales where curvature is expected to be negligible, we can fix the last parameter and obtain what is referred to as the Bunch-Davies (BD) vacuum. We use our obtained insight to compute the expectation value of the regularised energy momentum tensor for a general choice of de Sitter invariant vacua. We conclude that as long as we respect de Sitter invariance, we do not get any dynamic backreaction and only obtain a constant shift in the cosmological constant. We then look for the breaking of this isometry in the loop corrections of a self interacting \\( \\lambda \\phi^4 \\) theory, but find that it is generally also respected in loops, as long we restrict to a certain coordinate patch of de Sitter spacetime. Finally, we break de Sitter isometry explicitly by introducing a scalar metric perturbation to the de Sitter geometry. We introduce a free massive scalar field to our spacetime and estimate the backreaction by solving for the perturbation. Our results show that in the short wavelength (UV) regime the largest contribution to the metric perturbation decays while oscillating in a similar way to gravitational wave modes. In the long wavelength (IR) regime we find that one part of the solution significantly grows and these perturbations can no longer be considered small.

To identify the relevant physical processes to be included in the simulation, I have adapted the original code to the specific needs. I have learned a lot about numerical solvers and mesh refinement.
