        "excerpt":"Following in the footsteps of the LHCb collaboration, I worked on a project to validate the discovered evidence for CP violation in charmless, B meson decays. I developed a data analysis framework using ROOT to analyse the experimental data obtained by the LHCb experiment and wrote a scientific report on my results. Additionally, I learned a lot about the general work-flow in modern particle physics.                 This browser does not support PDF display.

        "title": "Background event classification for Belle II",
        "excerpt":"In this project I used neural networks to classify EvtGen simulated data into signal and background. The goal was to investigate the possibility of bypassing the expensive Geant4 detector simulation and following analysis. This project was done in the realms of the Belle-II experiment, but is applicable to all of experimental particle physics. It was a very new direction in the collaboration, where I helped to develop one of the first convolutional neutral networks for classification. By restructuring the network layers and managing to constructively input additional data (such as the decay string), I managed to improve the accuracy by over 10% and set the groundwork for future contributions. The project is still ongoing and being constantly improved.   During this project I learned about neural networks, some common design practises and options for handling and pre-processing data. I used Keras and other parts of Tensorflow to embed relevant data from the simulation and develop a convolutional neural network for classification of signal and background in particle collisions. Furthermore, I learned about the simulation side of particle physics and some details about general data handling.  ","categories": [],

I run a parallelized, static mesh refined simulation of the system using the magnetohydrodynamics code Athena++. To identify the relevant physical processes to be included in the simulation, I have adapted the original code to the specific needs. I have learned a lot about numerical solvers and mesh refinement. I run the code on the institute cluster with Slurm. The output of the simulation then has to be analysed and visualised, for which I use Python specific tools.  ","categories": [],
