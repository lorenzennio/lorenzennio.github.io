The goal was to investigate the possibility of bypassing the expensive &lt;em&gt;Geant4&lt;/em&gt; detector simulation and following analysis. This project was done in the realms of the Belle-II experiment, but is applicable to all of experimental particle physics. It was a very new direction in the collaboration, where I helped to develop one of the first convolutional neutral networks for classification. By restructuring the network layers and managing to constructively input additional data (such as the decay string), I managed to improve the accuracy by over 10% and set the groundwork for future contributions. The project is still ongoing and being constantly improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this project I learned about neural networks, some common design practises and options for handling and pre-processing data. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://keras.io/&quot;&gt;Keras&lt;/a&gt; and other parts of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/&quot;&gt;Tensorflow&lt;/a&gt; to embed relevant data from the simulation and develop a convolutional neural network for classification of signal and background in particle collisions. Furthermore, I learned about the simulation side of particle physics and some details about general data handling.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Lorenz Gaertner</name></author><summary type="html">In this project I used neural networks to classify EvtGen simulated data into signal and background.
