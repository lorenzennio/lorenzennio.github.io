Following in the footsteps of the LHCb collaboration, I worked on a project to validate the discovered evidence for CP violation in charmless, B meson decays. I developed a data analysis framework using [ROOT](https://root.cern/) to analyse the experimental data obtained by the LHCb experiment and wrote a scientific [report]({{ "/assets/pdfs/report.pdf" | relative_url }}) on my results. Additionally, I learned a lot about the general work-flow in modern particle physics.
