				I worked on building a neural network to classify simulated particle collision data, in the decay channel
				\(B \to K^∗ \nu \bar{\nu}. \)
				The goal of the project is to replace the computationally very expensive detector simulation, particle reconstruction and analysis, which is the current standard.
			</li>
			<li>
				As a newcomer to the field of neural networks, I independently taught myself the necessary skills to build very task specific and efficient neural networks.
			</li>
			<li>
				As one of the few people working on this project, my ideas and choices very much shaped the direction of the project.
			</li>
			<li>
				By the end of my internship, I had designed a completely new neural network. My work lead to an increase in classification accuracy by over 10%, compared to the best existing network for this task.
